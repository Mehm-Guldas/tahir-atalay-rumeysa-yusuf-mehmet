# Overview
The aim of this project was to develop an application that can translate American Sign Language (ASL) into written language, using object detection techniques and multiple data sources.​
# Defining The Problem ​And The Solution
* We want to improve communication and inclusion between people who use ASL and those who do not.​
* Our project uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and translate ASL signs into words.​
* Our project is an example of how technology can help overcome linguistic and cultural differences.
